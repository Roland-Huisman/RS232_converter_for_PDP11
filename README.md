This is a project to add a RS232 port to a PDP11/05 or PDP11/10 and probably other models. And it includes a BAUD rate clock generator to use higher BAUD rates then the standard settings. Since the UART in my PDP11/10 is rated at 22500 BAUD max I used the 19200 BAUD standard as maximum. I don't want to push these old chips outsite their specifications...

Selectable rates are: 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200 and the PDP11 internal BAUD rate setting.

Have fun!
